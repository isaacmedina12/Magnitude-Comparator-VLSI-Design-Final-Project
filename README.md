# EE103 | VLSI Design Final Project: 2-bit Unsigned CMOS Magnitude Comparator 
### Made by: Isaac Medina
This project uses CMOS transistor topology to implement the digital logic function of a 2-bit unsigned magnitude comparator. Given 2-bit unsigned numbers A and B (Decimal range: [0, 1, 2, 3]), the CMOS transistor network computes whether A is greater than, equal to, or less than B. There are three output signals: G, E, and L.
